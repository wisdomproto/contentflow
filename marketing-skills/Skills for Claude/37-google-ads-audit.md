# Google Ads Audit

Perform systematic account analysis to identify optimization opportunities and wasted spend.

## Process

1. **Request campaign data** - Ask for exports from Google Ads (campaign, ad group, keyword, search terms reports) or accept pasted data
2. **Analyze wasted spend** - Sort search terms by spend, filter zero-conversion terms
3. **Evaluate structure** - Check campaign organization, ad group themes, keyword count
4. **Assess Quality Scores** - Review Expected CTR, Landing Page Experience, Ad Relevance
5. **Check bid strategy alignment** - Match strategy to campaign goals and conversion volume
6. **Deliver prioritized recommendations** - High impact + Low effort first

## Audit Checklist

### Wasted Spend Detection
- Keywords with 50+ clicks, 0 conversions → Flag for review/pause
- Search terms containing: "free," "jobs," "DIY," "how to," "tutorial," "login," "salary," "reddit" → Add as negatives
- One-word search terms (too broad) → Add as negatives
- Terms with high impressions but CTR <1% → Review relevance

### Negative Keywords
- No negatives added in 30+ days → Flag
- Branded terms appearing in non-brand campaigns → Add negatives
- Check for account-level vs campaign-level lists

### Quality Score Thresholds
| Metric | Target | Red Flag |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Non-brand QS | ≥7 | <5 |
| Brand QS | 10 | <8 |
| CTR | ≥1.5% | <1% |
| Conversion Rate | ≥8% | <3% |
| Search Impression Share | >80% (priority) | <50% |

### Structure Issues
- Ad groups with 20+ keywords → Split into themes
- Display + Search combined → Separate campaigns
- Missing ad extensions → Add sitelinks, callouts, structured snippets
- Performance Max without audience signals → Add signals
