# 3/ Budget Scenario Planner — Google + Meta

## What it does
Models what happens to your CPA, ROAS, conversion volume, and impression share when you increase or decrease budget by any amount. Uses your actual account data and historical diminishing returns patterns, not generic industry assumptions.

## How it works
Claude looks at your historical spend-to-conversion relationship at different budget levels, maps the efficiency curve, and projects where you'll land at a new spend level. It accounts for auction dynamics, meaning that scaling 50% doesn't mean 50% more conversions — it models the real falloff.

## Practical example
Client wants to go from $30K/month to $50K/month on Meta. Claude analyzes the last 90 days and shows that the first $10K increase will bring CPA from $38 to $43 (still within target), but the last $10K pushes CPA to $58 because you'll exhaust the high-intent audience and start hitting colder segments. Recommendation: scale to $40K first, test new audiences, then push to $50K.

## What you get back
- Projected CPA, ROAS, and conversion volume at each budget level
- The efficiency curve showing where diminishing returns kick in
- Break-even points where scaling stops making financial sense
- Recommended budget level with reasoning
- Comparison across campaigns showing which ones have the most room to scale

## When to use it
- Client or leadership asks to increase or cut budget
- Quarterly planning when setting budget allocations
- When deciding which campaigns deserve more budget
- Before pitching a budget increase to show the projected return
